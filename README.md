# Solutions

## Day 1

python with some arithmetic in brainfuck

[python code](/day01.py)

[brainfuck "sum chunks" for part 1](/day01_part1_sum_chunks.b)

[brainfuck "add 3 numbers"...](/day01_part2_sum3.b)

## Day 2

by hand in google docs/calculator

![part 1 ctrl-f for X, Y, Z, A X etc](/day02_part1.png)
![part 2 ctrl-f for A X, A Y, etc](/day02_part2.png)

## Day 3

### 3-1

in godot: pass the left half and right half of the background through each other, increasing the score whenever a collision happens. make a big explosion upon collision to remove duplicates

[godot project](/day03_part1/)

![part 1: lots of black boxes with letters, long orange rectangles and a score counter](/day03_part1_screenshot.png)

### 3-2

in python, code golfed to 95 bytes (loads a file called "3" in the same directory; there's a setup batch script to copy that from the inputs folder)

[python file](/day03_part2/day03_part2_95bytes.py)

## Day 4

### 4-1

work in progress: python + brainfuck

## Day 5

todo

## Day 6

by hand with pen + paper

![part 1: dots under the first many letters, column count and calculations on the side](/day06_part1.jpg)

![part 2: messy lines under letters in the middle, incorrect + correct calculations on the side](/day06_part2.jpg)

## Day 7

python (writing to/querying the filesystem, of course; only tested on windows)

[python code](/day07.py)

# Reverse Lookup

days by language / method / etc

## godot

- [day 3 part 1](#3-1)

## python + brainfuck

- [day 1](#day-1)
- [day 4 part 1](#4-1)

## python (gode colfed)

- [day 3 part 2](#3-2) 95 bytes

## just python...

- [day 7](#day-7)

## minimal computer assistance

- [day 2](#day-2) in google docs
- [day 6](#day-6) by hand with pen + paper
