## Day 3

### Part 1

in godot: pass the left half and right half of the background through each other, increasing the score whenever a collision happens. make a big explosion upon collision to remove duplicates

![part 1: lots of black boxes with letters, long orange rectangles and a score counter](/day03_part1_screenshot.png)

### Part 2

in python, code golfed to 106 bytes (loads a file called "3" in the same directory; there's a setup batch script to copy that from the inputs folder)

## Day 4
