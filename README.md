[reverse lookup](#reverse-lookup) (by language / method)

[Day 1](#day-1)
[Day 2](#day-2)
[Day 3](#day-3)
[Day 4](#day-4)
[Day 5](#day-5)
[Day 6](#day-6)
[Day 7](#day-7)

## Day 1

python with some arithmetic in brainfuck

## Day 2

by hand in google docs/calculator

![part 1 ctrl-f for X, Y, Z, A X etc](/day02_part1.png)
![part 2 ctrl-f for A X, A Y, etc](/day02_part2.png)

## Day 3

### 3-1

in godot: pass the left half and right half of the background through each other, increasing the score whenever a collision happens. make a big explosion upon collision to remove duplicates

![part 1: lots of black boxes with letters, long orange rectangles and a score counter](/day03_part1_screenshot.png)

### 3-2

in python, code golfed to 106 bytes (loads a file called "3" in the same directory; there's a setup batch script to copy that from the inputs folder)

## Day 4

### 4-1

work in progress: python + brainfuck

## Day 5

todo

## Day 6

by hand with pen + paper

![part 1: dots under the first many letters, column count and calculations on the side](/day06_part1.jpg)

![part 2: messy lines under letters in the middle, incorrect + correct calculations on the side](/day06_part2.jpg)
